<p>Planning permission or developmental approval refers to the approval needed for construction or expansion (including significant renovation) in some jurisdictions. It is usually given in the form of a building permit (or construction permit). Generally, the new construction must be inspected during construction and after completion to ensure compliance with national, regional, and local building codes. Planning is also dependent on the site’s zone – for example, one cannot obtain permission to build a nightclub in an area where it is inappropriate, such as a high-density suburb. Failure to obtain a permit can result in fines, penalties, and demolition of unauthorized construction if it cannot be made to meet code. House building permits, for example, are subject to local housing statutes. The criteria for planning permission is a part of urban planning and construction law and usually managed by local government employed town planners. Since building permits usually precede outlays for construction, employment, financing and furnishings, they are often a leading indicator for developments in other areas of the economy.</p>
