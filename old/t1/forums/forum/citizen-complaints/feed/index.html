						<![CDATA[
						<p>The English word &#8220;Municipality&#8221; derives from the Latin social contract &#8220;municipium&#8221;, meaning duty holders, referring to the Latin communities that supplied Rome with troops in exchange for their own incorporation into the Roman state (granting Roman citizenship to the inhabitants) while permitting the communities to retain their own local governments (a limited autonomy).</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>In the United Kingdom, the term was used until 1974 in England and Wales, and until 1975 in Scotland and 1976 in Northern Ireland, &#8220;both for a city or town which is organized for self-government under a municipal corporation, and also for the governing body itself. Such a corporation in Great Britain consists of a head as a mayor or provost, and of superior members, as aldermen and councillors&#8221;. Since local government reorganisation, the unit in England, Northern Ireland and Wales is known as a district, and in Scotland as a council area. A district may be awarded borough or city status, or can retain its district title.</p>

						<p>Town, village, or other local government unit, formed by municipal charter from the state as a municipal corporation.[10] In a state law context, some U.S. state codes define &#8220;municipality&#8221; more widely, from the state itself to any political subdivisions given jurisdiction over an area that may include multiple populated places and unpopulated places.</p>
