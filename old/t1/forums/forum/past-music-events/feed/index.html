						<p>Some critics of summer vacation point out that American students spend approximately 180 days (26 weeks) per year in school, but Asian students are &#8220;in school for 240 to 250 days&#8221;. This is consistent with the conclusions of researchers[4] who suggest that advanced abilities are in proportion to the time spent learning. Summer holidays in Japan last from late July until early September.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Some countries only get six weeks or two months summer vacation because students supposedly forget large amounts of information learned in the past year (See: Summer learning loss). Other education reformers believed that children were overstimulated in a system which required 48 weeks of schooling. They believe that over-schooling could lead to nervous disorders, depression, insanity, and separation anxiety towards families. They believe that children need the 2–3 months off to relax and also to take a break from other childhood stresses associated with school such as peer pressure, cliques, bullying, and the pressure of heavy loads of homework.</p>

						<p>Milwaukee, Wisconsin&#8217;s 11-day event, Summerfest, promotes itself as &#8220;The World&#8217;s Largest Music Festival&#8221;, a title certified by the Guinness World Records and held since 1999. Operating annually since 1968, the festival attracts between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people each year, and hosts over 800 musical acts. The Woodstock Festival in 1969 drew nearly 500,000 attendees, and the Polish spin-off Przystanek Woodstock drew 700,000 in 2011.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Initially, some of the earliest rock festivals were built on the foundation of pre-existing jazz and blues festivals, but quickly evolved to reflect the rapidly changing musical tastes of the time. For example, the United Kingdom’s National Jazz Festival was launched in Richmond from August 26–27, 1961. The first three of these annual outdoor festivals featured only jazz music, but by the fourth &#8220;Jazz &amp; Blues Festival&#8221; in 1964, a shift had begun that incorporated some blues and pop artists into the lineup. In 1965, for the first time the event included more blues, pop and rock acts than jazz, and by 1966, when the event moved to the town of Windsor, the rock and pop acts clearly dominated the jazz artists.</p>

						<p>Another type of music festival is the educative type, organized annually in local communities, regionally or nationally, for the benefit of amateur musicians of all ages and grades of achievement. While entrants perform prepared pieces in the presence of an audience which includes competitors, the essential feature of this type of festival is that each participant receives verbal and written feedback, there and then, from a highly qualified, professional adjudicator—someone whom they might never meet in any other way.</p>
