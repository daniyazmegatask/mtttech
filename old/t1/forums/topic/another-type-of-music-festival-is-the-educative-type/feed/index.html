						<p>Organized annually in local communities, regionally or nationally, for the benefit of amateur musicians of all ages and grades of achievement. While entrants perform prepared pieces in the presence of an audience which includes competitors, the essential feature of this type of festival is that each participant receives verbal and written feedback, there and then, from a highly qualified, professional adjudicatorâ€”someone whom they might never meet in any other way.</p>

						<p>Milwaukee, Wisconsin&#8217;s 11-day event, Summerfest, promotes itself as &#8220;The World&#8217;s Largest Music Festival&#8221;, a title certified by the Guinness World Records and held since 1999. Operating annually since 1968, the festival attracts between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people each year, and hosts over 800 musical acts. The Woodstock Festival in 1969 drew nearly 500,000 attendees, and the Polish spin-off Przystanek Woodstock drew 700,000 in 2011.</p>
