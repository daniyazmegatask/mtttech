						<p>The English word &#8220;Municipality&#8221; derives from the Latin social contract &#8220;municipium&#8221;, meaning duty holders, referring to the Latin communities that supplied Rome with troops in exchange for their own incorporation into the Roman state (granting Roman citizenship to the inhabitants) while permitting the communities to retain their own local governments (a limited autonomy).</p>
