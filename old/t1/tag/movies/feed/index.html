<p>An independent film is a film production resulting in a feature film that is produced mostly or completely outside of the major film studio system. In addition to being produced and distributed by independent entertainment companies, independent films are also produced and/or distributed by subsidiaries of major film studios.</p>



<p>Independent films are sometimes distinguishable by their content and style and the way in which the filmmakersâ€™ personal artistic vision is realized. Usually, but not always, independent films are made with considerably lower film budgets than major studio films.</p>



<p>Generally, the marketing of independent films is characterized by limited release, but can also have major marketing campaigns and a wide release. Independent films are often screened at local, national, or international film festivals before distribution (theatrical and/or retail release). An independent film production can rival a mainstream film production if it has the necessary funding and distribution.</p>
