Each of the United Kingdom\u2019s four constituent countries has its own structure of local government, for example Northern Ireland has local districts; many parts of England have non-metropolitan counties consisting of rural districts; London and many other urban areas have boroughs; there are three islands councils off the coast of Scotland; while the rest of Scotland and all of Wales are divided into unitary authority counties, some of which are officially designated as cities. As such the term local government area is a convenient generic label referring to all of these authorities and the areas within their control.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A local government area (LGA) is an administrative division of a country that a local government is responsible for.
