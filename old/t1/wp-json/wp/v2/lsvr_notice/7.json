The users of a road include pedestrians, cyclists, motorists, their passengers, and passengers of on-road public transport, mainly buses and trams. Best-practice road safety strategies focus upon the prevention of serious injury and death crashes in spite of human fallibility (which is contrasted with the old road safety paradigm of simply reducing crashes assuming road user compliance with traffic regulations). Safe road design is now about providing a road environment which ensures vehicle speeds will be within the human tolerances for serious injury and death wherever conflict points exist.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"template":"","meta":{"_bbp_topic_count":0,"_bbp_reply_count":0,"_bbp_total_topic_count":0,"_bbp_total_reply_count":0,"_bbp_voice_count":0,"_bbp_anonymous_reply_count":0,"_bbp_topic_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_reply_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_forum_subforum_count":0},"lsvr_notice_cat":[8],"lsvr_notice_tag":[11,12],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lsvr_notice\/7"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lsvr_notice"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/lsvr_notice"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"lsvr_notice_cat","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lsvr_notice_cat?post=7"},{"taxonomy":"lsvr_notice_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lsvr_notice_tag?post=7"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
