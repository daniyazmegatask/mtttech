The top-ranked competitors in each fixture progress to the next round. As rounds progress, the number of competitors and fixtures decreases. The final round, usually known as the final or cup final, consists of just one fixture; the winner of which is the overall champion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a single-elimination tournament, only the top-ranked competitors in a fixture progress; in 2-competitor games, only the winner progresses. All other competitors are eliminated. This ensures a winner is decided with the minimum number of fixtures. However, most competitors will be eliminated after relatively few matches; a single bad or unlucky performance can nullify many preceding excellent ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A double-elimination tournament may be used in 2-competitor games to allow each competitor a single loss without being eliminated from the tournament. All losers from the main bracket enter a losers&#8217; bracket, the winner of which plays off against the main bracket&#8217;s winner.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"template":"","meta":{"_bbp_topic_count":0,"_bbp_reply_count":0,"_bbp_total_topic_count":0,"_bbp_total_reply_count":0,"_bbp_voice_count":0,"_bbp_anonymous_reply_count":0,"_bbp_topic_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_reply_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_forum_subforum_count":0},"lsvr_notice_cat":[13],"lsvr_notice_tag":[16,17],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lsvr_notice\/9"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lsvr_notice"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/lsvr_notice"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=9"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"lsvr_notice_cat","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lsvr_notice_cat?post=9"},{"taxonomy":"lsvr_notice_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/townpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/lsvr_notice_tag?post=9"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
