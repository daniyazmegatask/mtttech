Contemporary art includes, and develops from, Postmodern art, which is itself a successor to Modern art. In vernacular English, \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201ccontemporary\u201d are synonyms, resulting in some conflation of the terms \u201cmodern art\u201d and \u201ccontemporary art\u201d by non-specialists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The classification of &#8220;contemporary art&#8221; as a special type of art, rather than a general adjectival phrase, goes back to the beginnings of Modernism in the English-speaking world. In London, the Contemporary Art Society was founded in 1910 by the critic Roger Fry and others, as a private society for buying works of art to place in public museums. A number of other institutions using the term were founded in the 1930s, such as in 1938 the Contemporary Art Society of Adelaide, Australia, and an increasing number after 1945. Many, like the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston changed their names from ones using &#8220;Modern art&#8221; in this period, as Modernism became defined as a historical art movement, and much &#8220;modern&#8221; art ceased to be &#8220;contemporary&#8221;. The definition of what is contemporary is naturally always on the move, anchored in the present with a start date that moves forward, and the works the Contemporary Art Society bought in 1910 could no longer be described as contemporary.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contemporary art is art produced at the present period in time.
