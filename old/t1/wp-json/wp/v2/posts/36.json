Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of wild nature for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \u201cNational Park\u201d as its Category II type of protected areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this type of national park had been proposed previously, the United States established the first \u201cpublic park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people\u201d, Yellowstone National Park, in 1872. Although Yellowstone was not officially termed a \u201cnational park\u201d in its establishing law, it was always termed such in practice and is widely held to be the first and oldest national park in the world. Some would say that the first official national park to be designated as such at its creation was Mackinac Island, legislated in 1875. Australia\u2019s Royal National Park, established in 1879, was the world\u2019s third official national park. In 1895 ownership of Mackinac Island was transferred to the State of Michigan as a state park and national park status was consequently lost. As a result Australia\u2019s Royal National Park is by some considerations the second oldest national park now in existence.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes.
